# Judging a Book by Its Cover
This repository contains the code for my final project of CS 4262: Foundations of Machine Learning. 

Dataset: [https://github.com/uchidalab/book-dataset](https://github.com/uchidalab/book-dataset)

Goal: Given the image of a book, classify its genre.

## Set-up
To download the data: Visit [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hK5ILpMSSxpeQ_2MTw8q95hMDnGyqu2o/view?usp=sharing) or run `data/download-dataset.sh`

To install the conda environment:
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate book-covers
```

Other ideas to explore: 
- Give image + title
- Permutation-invariant neural networks
